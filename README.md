# GT

English | [简体中文](./README_CN.md)

GT is an open source reverse proxy project that supports peer-to-peer direct connection (P2P) and Internet relay.

It has the following design features:

- Emphasis on privacy protection, minimize server-side packet analysis to ensure functionality while protecting privacy,
  such as TCP-based implementation, analyze only the HTTP protocol header of the first data packet for application layer
  HTTP protocol transmission, without any redundant analysis, and directly forward subsequent data.

- Emphasis on performance, code implementation tends to use higher performance designs, such as modifying standard
  libraries to implement designs that reduce memory allocation and copying.

- P2P connection functionality implemented based on WebRTC, support all platforms that support WebRTC, such as iOS,
  Android, browsers, etc.

Currently implemented main functions:

- Forward communication protocols based on TCP, such as HTTP(S), WebSocket(S), SSH, SMB
- WebRTC P2P connection
- Multi-user functionality
  - Support multiple user authentication methods: API service, local configuration
  - Each user has independent configuration
  - Limit user speed
  - Limit number of client connections
  - Refuse access for a period of time if authentication fails more than a certain number of times
- Communication between server and client uses TCP connection pool
- Maintain consistency between command line parameters and YAML configuration parameters
- Support log reporting to Sentry service

## Usage

### Configuration File

Configuration files use YAML format. Both clients and servers can use configuration files.

```shell
./release/linux-amd64-server -config server.yaml
./release/linux-amd64-client -config client.yaml
```

See the [server.yaml](example/config/server.yaml) file for a basic server configuration.
See the [client.yaml](example/config/client.yaml) file for a basic client configuration.

### Server User Configuration

The following four ways can be used simultaneously. Conflicts are resolved in order of decreasing priority from top to
bottom.

#### Configure Users via Command Line

The ith id matches the ith secret. The following two startup methods are equivalent:

```shell
./release/linux-amd64-server -addr 8080 -id id1 -secret secret1 -id id2 -secret secret2
```

```shell
./release/linux-amd64-server -addr 8080 -id id1 -id id2 -secret secret1 -secret secret2
```

#### Configure Users via Users Configuration File

```yaml
id3:
  secret: secret3
id1:
  secret: secret1-overwrite
```

#### Configure Users via Config Configuration File

```yaml
version: 1.0
users:
  id1:
    secret: secret1
  id2:
    secret: secret2
options:
  apiAddr: 1.2.3.4:1234
  certFile: /path
  keyFile: /path
  logFile: /path
  logFileMaxCount: 1234
  logFileMaxSize: 1234
  logLevel: debug
  addr: 1234
  timeout: 1234m1234ms
  tlsAddr: 1234
  tlsVersion: tls1.3
  users: testdata/users.yaml
```

#### Allow All Clients

Add `-allowAnyClient` to the server startup parameters to allow all clients to connect to the server without
configuration on the server side. But the `secret` of the first client connecting to the server with the same `id` will
be used as the correct `secret` and cannot be overwritten by the `secret` of subsequent clients connecting to the server
with the same `id` to ensure security.

### Server TCP Configuration

The following three ways can be used simultaneously. Priority: User > Global. User priority: users configuration file >
config configuration file. Global priority: command line > config configuration file. If TCP is not configured, it means
TCP functionality is not enabled.

#### Configure TCP via Users Configuration File

The users configuration file can configure TCP for individual users. The following configuration file indicates that
user id1 can open TCP ports of any number and any port, and user id2 does not have the permission to open TCP ports.

```yaml
id1:
  secret: secret1
  tcp:
    - range: 1-65535
id2:
  secret: secret2  
```

#### Configure TCP via Config Configuration File

The config configuration file can configure global TCP and TCP for individual users. The following configuration file
indicates that user id1 can open TCP ports of any number and between ports
10000 to 20000, and user id2 can open 1 TCP port between ports
50000 to 65535.

```yaml
version: 1.0
users:
  id1:
    secret: secret1
    tcp:
      - range: 10000-20000
    tcpNumber: 0
  id2:
    secret: secret2
tcp:
  - range: 50000-65535
options:
  apiAddr: 1.2.3.4:1234
  certFile: /path
  keyFile: /path
  logFile: /path
  logFileMaxCount: 1234
  logFileMaxSize: 1234
  logLevel: debug
  addr: 1234
  timeout: 1234m1234ms
  tlsAddr: 1234
  tlsVersion: tls1.3
  users: testdata/users.yaml
  tcpNumber: 1
```

### Command Line Parameters

```shell
./release/linux-amd64-server -h
./release/linux-amd64-client -h
```

#### Internal HTTP Penetration

- Requirement: There is an internal network server and a public network server, and id1.example.com resolves to the
  address of the public network server. It is hoped to access the webpage service on port 80 of the internal network
  server through accessing id1.example.com:8080.

- Server (Public network server)

```shell
./release/linux-amd64-server -addr 8080 -id id1 -secret secret1
```

- Client (Internal network server)

```shell
./release/linux-amd64-client -local http://127.0.0.1:80 -remote tcp://id1.example.com:8080 -id id1 -secret secret1
```

#### Internal HTTPS Penetration

- Requirement: There is an internal network server and a public network server, and id1.example.com resolves to the
  address of the public network server. It is hoped to access the HTTP webpage provided on port 80 of the internal
  network server through accessing <https://id1.example.com>

- Server (Public network server)

```shell
./release/linux-amd64-server -addr "" -tlsAddr 443 -certFile /root/openssl_crt/tls.crt -keyFile /root/openssl_crt/tls.key -id id1 -secret secret1
```

- Client (Internal network server), uses the `-remoteCertInsecure` option as a self-signed certificate is used,
  otherwise this option should not be used (encryption content is decrypted due to man-in-the-middle attack)

```shell
./release/linux-amd64-client -local http://127.0.0.1 -remote tls://id1.example.com -remoteCertInsecure -id id1 -secret secret1  
```

#### Internal HTTPS SNI Penetration

- Requirement: There is an internal network server and a public network server, and id1.example.com resolves to the
  address of the public network server. It is hoped to access the HTTPS webpage provided on port 443 of the internal
  network server through accessing <https://id1.example.com>

- Server (Public network server)

```shell
./release/linux-amd64-server -addr 8080 -sniAddr 443 -id id1 -secret secret1
```

- Client (Internal network server)

```shell 
./release/linux-amd64-client -local https://127.0.0.1 -remote tcp://id1.example.com:8080 -id id1 -secret secret1
```

#### Encrypt Client-Server Communication with TLS

- Requirement: There is an internal network server and a public network server, and id1.example.com resolves to the
  address of the public network server. It is hoped to access the webpage service on port 80 of the internal network
  server through accessing id1.example.com:8080. Meanwhile, use TLS to encrypt the communication between the client and
  server.

- Server (Public network server)

```shell
./release/linux-amd64-server -addr 8080 -tlsAddr 443 -certFile /root/openssl_crt/tls.crt -keyFile /root/openssl_crt/tls.key -id id1 -secret secret1
```

- Client (Internal network server), uses the `-remoteCertInsecure` option as a self-signed certificate is used,
  otherwise this option should not be used (encryption content is decrypted due to man-in-the-middle attack)

```shell  
./release/linux-amd64-client -local http://127.0.0.1:80 -remote tls://id1.example.com -remoteCertInsecure -id id1 -secret secret1
```

#### Internal TCP Penetration

- Requirement: There is an internal network server and a public network server, and id1.example.com resolves to the
  address of the public network server. It is hoped to access the SSH service on port 22 of the internal network server
  through accessing id1.example.com:2222, and if the 2222 port is not available on the server side, the server selects a
  random port.

- Server (Public network server)

```shell
./release/linux-amd64-server -addr 8080 -id id1 -secret secret1 -tcpNumber 1 -tcpRange 1024-65535
```

- Client (Internal network server)

```shell
./release/linux-amd64-client -local tcp://127.0.0.1:22 -remote tcp://id1.example.com:8080 -id id1 -secret secret1 -remoteTCPPort 2222 -remoteTCPRandom
```

#### Internal QUIC Penetration

- Requirements: There is an intranet server and a public network server, and id1.example.com resolves to the address of the public network server. Hopefully by accessing id1.example.com:8080
  To access the web page served by port 80 on the intranet server. Use QUIC to build a transport connection between the client and the server. QUIC uses TLS 1.3 for transport encryption. When the user also gives certFile
  and keyFile, use them for encrypted communication. Otherwise, keys and certificates are automatically generated using the ECDSA encryption algorithm.

- Server (public network server)

```shell
./release/linux-amd64-server -addr 8080 -quicAddr 443 -certFile /root/openssl_crt/tls.crt -keyFile /root/openssl_crt/tls.key -id id1 -secret secret1
```

- Client (internal network server), because a self-signed certificate is used, the `-remoteCertInsecure` option is used. This option is prohibited from being used in other cases (man-in-the-middle attacks cause encrypted content to be decrypted

```shell
./release/linux-amd64-client -local http://127.0.0.1:80 -remote quic://id1.example.com:443 -remoteCertInsecure -id id1 -secret secret1
```

#### Intelligent Internal Penetration (Adaptive Selection of TCP/QUIC)

- - Requirements: There is an intranet server and a public network server, and id1.example.com resolves to the address of the public network server. Hopefully by accessing id1.example.com:8080
    To access the web page served by port 80 on the intranet server. GT server listens to multiple addresses. GT client provides multiple `-remote` options and currently supports intelligent switching between QUIC and TCP/TLS.
    GT client concurrently sends multiple sets of network status detection probes through QUIC connections to obtain the network delay and packet loss rate between the intranet server and the public network server.
    Input the trained XGBoost model to obtain the results, and adaptively select whether to use TCP+TLS or QUIC for intranet penetration.

- Server (public network server)

```shell
./release/linux-amd64-server -addr 8080 -quicAddr 443 -certFile /root/openssl_crt/tls.crt -keyFile /root/openssl_crt/tls.key -id id1 -secret secret1
```

- Client (intranet server). `-remote` requires at least one QUIC address to be given.

```shell
./release/linux-amd64-client -local http://127.0.0.1:80 -remote quic://id1.example.com:443 -remote tcp://id1.example.com:8080 -remoteCertInsecure -id id1 -secret secret1
```

#### Client Start Multiple Services Simultaneously

- Requirement: There is an internal network server and a public network server, and id1-1.example.com and
  id1-2.example.com resolve to the address of the public network server. It is hoped to access the service on port 80 of
  the internal network server through accessing id1-1.example.com:8080, and to access the service on port 8080 of the
  internal network server through accessing id1-2.example.com:8080, and to access the service on port 2222 of the
  internal network server through accessing id1-1.example.com:2222, and to access the service on port 2223 of the
  internal network server through accessing id1-1.example.com:2223. At the same time, the server limits the client's
  hostPrefix to only contain digits or letters.

- Note: In this mode, the parameters corresponding to the client local (remoteTCPPort, hostPrefix, etc.) need to be
  placed between this local and the next local.

- Server (Public network server)

```shell
./release/linux-amd64-server -addr 8080 -id id1 -secret secret1 -tcpNumber 2 -tcpRange 1024-65535 -hostNumber 2 -hostWithID -hostRegex ^[0-9]+$ -hostRegex ^[a-zA-Z]+$
```

- Client (Internal network server)

```shell
./release/linux-amd64-client -remote tcp://id1.example.com:8080 -id id1 -secret secret1 \
   -local http://127.0.0.1:80 -useLocalAsHTTPHost -hostPrefix 1 \
   -local http://127.0.0.1:8080 -useLocalAsHTTPHost -hostPrefix 2 \
   -local tcp://127.0.0.1:2222 -remoteTCPPort 2222 \
   -local tcp://127.0.0.1:2223 -remoteTCPPort 2223
```

The above command line can also be started using a configuration file:

```shell
./release/linux-amd64-client -config client.yaml
```

client.yaml file content:

```yaml
services:
  - local: http://127.0.0.1:80
    useLocalAsHTTPHost: true
    hostPrefix: 1
  - local: http://127.0.0.1:8080
    useLocalAsHTTPHost: true
    hostPrefix: 2
  - local: tcp://127.0.0.1:2222
    remoteTCPPort: 2222
  - local: tcp://127.0.0.1:2223
    remoteTCPPort: 2223
options:
  remote: tcp://id1.example.com:8080
  id: id1
  secret: secret1
```

#### Server API

The server API detects service availability by simulating a client. The following example can help you better understand
this point, where id1.example.com resolves to the address of the public network server. HTTPS is used when apiCertFile
and apiKeyFile options are not empty, otherwise HTTP is used.

- Server (Public network server)

```shell
./release/linux-amd64-server -addr 8080 -apiAddr 8081
```

- User

```shell
# curl http://id1.example.com:8081/status
{"status": "ok", "version":"linux-amd64-server - 2022-12-09 05:20:24 - dev 88d322f"}
```

### Group 3 (Ubuntu environment+short request testing)

By using wrk for stress testing, this project is compared with frp. Each request only returns a field response of less 
than 10 bytes, which is used to simulate HTTP short requests. The test results are as follows:

#### GT-TCP
